    <p>
      Ever since I was a kid, I've always had a pencil in my hand. While other kids were outside or glued to their games, I was the one filling notebooks with sketches, characters, and ideas I couldn't help but bring to life. Drawing wasn't just something I liked — it was the one place where everything made sense.
      <br><br>
      As I got older, that childhood hobby slowly turned into something bigger. I started learning digital tools, taking on small projects for friends, and realizing that creating wasn't just something I did for fun — it was something I wanted to build my life around. Every design I worked on made me want to grow more, learn more, and push what I could do.
      <br><br>
      Today, I get to do what younger me always dreamed of: turning creativity into a career. Whether it's a custom commission, a brand design, or a full creative project, I put the same passion into my work that I had the day I first picked up a pencil. This isn't just my job — it's my story, my passion, and the thing that's shaped who I am. And now I'm here to help bring your ideas to life with that same energy and dedication.
